EV Charger Issue Form is a web application for submission of tickets for customers using the network of EV chargers.

It is built using HTML, CSS, JS, EJS, Node.js and MongoDB.

Users can submit tickets without login. 

Admins can log into the Admin panel, which displays all the tickets.

EV Charger Issue Form was the final project in my JavaScript course at Conestoga College.
